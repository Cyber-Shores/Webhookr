### How to use:

1. make sure you have the latest Long Term Support version of Node.js installed. https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (if this is not working, the experimental build should also work fine) 
2. run `npm install` in root directory (w/o the backticks)
3. make sure the .env file (will be sent separately) is named ".env"
4. run start.bat or `npx ts-node-dev --respawn bot.ts` in the root directory
