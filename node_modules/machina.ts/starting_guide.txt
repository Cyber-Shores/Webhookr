Look in the examples folder if you like examples.
Everything covered here can be seen in that folder. 
NOTE: your imports wont have the same file paths, but they will have the same variables

To use this framework you must have Typescript installed
(it would be best if you installed typescript node dev, its basically nodemon for typescript)
(to run using typescript node dev: tsnd --respawn {path to index}.ts )

First, create a file that is going to be the starting of your project.
In that file:
    import Machinam extractClasses from machina.ts 
    import arrify from machina.ts (optional, but recommended)

    import dotenv and run the config function (optional, but recommended if you are about token safety)

    Create an instance of the Machina class. The arguments go token (env file's token), prefix, {your username, your icon}
        For simplicity, I will refer to that instance as Hash

    IF USING CLASS FORMAT: 
        Use loadClasses on that instance to load the commands. Ex: Hash.loadClasses(extractClasses("file", "general.ts"))
            You can load them how you want, but you should use extractClasses from machinaUtility
    IF USING NON-CLASS FORMAT:
        Use loadCommands on that instance to laod the commands. The commands should be of type MachinaFunction
 
    Use initialize on that instance to start the bot. Ex. Hash.initialize()
        This is where you would start things like mongodb or anything else 

    Now you are done! (for the basics)

    If you want access to the client, do Hash.client (this is where you would listen to message, etc)

Listen for messages Example (in starting file):
    Create a listener for message on the client 
    Ex: Hash.client.on("message", msg => {})

    Inside that anonymous function:
        If you want to evaluate the message and check for commands run this:
            const cmd = Hash.evaluateMsg(msg)
                The variable name doesnt matter, but for clarity it will be called cmd. 
    
        cmd has three properties: reason, value, and extra
        Extra is extra information, not really important
        Value is the commands found 
        Reason is the status. This tells you if the user failed authroization, if there were no commands found, etc.

        Its recommended that you check for "no commands available" and "permission check passed mutliple" (mutliple commands found)
            There are static functions on the machina class that can help with that: Machina.noCommands() and Machina.mutlipleCommands()
                Make sure to put the correct arguments inside them
        To run the command simply run it and pass in the instance of the Machina class and the msg.
    
    This is an example of what it could look like:
    Hash.client.on("message", async msg => {
        let cmd = Hash.evaluateMsg(msg)
        if(cmd.reason == "no commands available")
            return Machina.noCommands(msg, cmd.extra)
        if(cmd.reason == "permission check passed multiple")
            return Machina.multipleCommands(msg, arrify(cmd.value))
        if(cmd.value)
            arrify(cmd.value)?.forEach(f => f(Hash, msg))
    })

Creating commands using class format:

    Create a class of any name and export it 
    Ex: export class General {}

    In that class: 
        To create an indivual command use this format:
            @machinaDecoratorInfo({monikers: /* what the user will write to call your commnad*/, description: /* the description of the command */, ...}) // To get more information about the arguments for this command, look in machinaFunction.ts
            static /* name of function */: MachinaFunction = /* put async here if you need it */ (params: MachinaFunctionParameters) => {
                // this is where your code will go 
            }

            In the example above, make sure monikers is a list and you put that in. Also, make sure you put a description. There are more options that you can add, such as arguments. 
            Replace name of function with the name of the function 

            params has a couple properties that include: info, Bot, msg, args, and argsInfo.
            info is the information given to the command (the info in the machinaDecoratorInfo)
            Bot is the instance of the bot (the Machina object)
            msg is the discord msg (the type is Discord.Message)
            args is a list of arguments that the user inputted (the type is MachianArgsTypes[])
            argsInfo is the information about the arguments (if you put any arguments in machinaDecoratorInfo also the type is MachinaArgsInfo)
                The structure of argsInfo is kinda complicated, so here is a break down
                    value: true/false - did the user follow the arguments
                    extra: number - the index of the argument like if it matches the first argument ([ this one -> [...],[...],[...]]). then it would be 0, the second would be 1, etc.
                        Note that it can match single arguments as well as lists of arguments
                    results: {expected: what it wants, received: what the user put, result} (this is in 1 array if you dont have any lists of arguments, else it has another level)
                    extraResults: list of added arguments that the user put 
            
    Example of that file:
    // Start
    /* pretend the imports are here */
    export class General {
        @machinaDecoratorInfo({monikers: ["test"], description: "a simple test that sends hello"})
        static test: MachinaFunction = async (params: MachinaFunctionParameters) => {
            console.log("Sending Test Message")
            await new MachinaMessage({title: "Test", description: "A test", params.msg}).send()
            console.laod("Test Message has been sent")
        }

        // imagine the top thing but multiple times with different stuff cause they are different commands
    }
    // End 

    If you dont know how to load this, all you need to do is Hash.loadClass(extractClasses("file", "general.ts")) in your main file
        Replace Hash with the name of your bot instance (of Machina), and replace general.ts with the file name.

Creating commands in a non class format:
    If you are doing it this way, ill assume that you know how things work but you dont know how decorators work in particular
    If you are a beginnner, you should use the class method

    In the file that you are going to have your commands in, all you need to do is this:
    export const /* name of function */: MachinaFunction = machinaDecoratorInfo({monikers: /* what the user will write to call your commnad*/, description: /* the description of the command */, ...})
    ("Class Name", "Name of funciton", /* put async here if you need it */ (params: MachinaFunctionParameters) => {
        // this is where your code will go 
    })
